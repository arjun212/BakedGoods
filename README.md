THINGS TO DO
========================================================


1) Feature Engineering
  Look at all the data given, and highlight the best features to use
  Which features are dependant, and can be accumalated together


2) Data Reformat
  Create python scripts to get the correct data (features), and
  format them in such a way that our machine learning algorithms
  can use them (json/csv/flatFile)

3) Find/Create C++ ML Algorithms
  Find/Create machine learning algorithms that will use our features
  and make good predictions






========================================================
MINOR THINGS TO DO
========================================================

1) Find/Create a server
  Either AWS, or open ports on shree's comp

2) Database viability
  Check if database is a viable option, train file has 
  74M records, python can handle, but is it worth it?
